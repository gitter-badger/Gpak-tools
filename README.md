## GPAK tools

C# library for reading **GPAK** files (have *.gp* extension) which were utilized for storing graphical data in some old games (such as **Cossacks** and **American Conquest** from **GSC Game World** company). Library produces Bitmap objects which can be saved using ordinary image format (e.g. *PNG*).

Format specs were reverse engineered completely from scratch. There is still room for improvements since not all available GP files can be successfully recovered.
